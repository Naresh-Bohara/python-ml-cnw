# Module: module is a file that contains Python code. It can define functions, classes, and variables, and can also include runnable code. Modules allow you to organize your code into manageable sections and reuse code across different parts of your program or even in different programs.
# In Python, you can create a module by simply saving your code in a file with a .py extension. For example, if you have a file named my_module.py, you can import it in another Python file using the import statement.
# For example:
# my_module.py
# def greet(name):
#     return f"Hello, {name}!"
# main.py
# import my_module
